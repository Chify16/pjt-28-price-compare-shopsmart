# INTRODUCTION
Price comparison websites are also known as "aggregators" because they collect product information from multiple websites that offer online shopping for the product. These websites provide you with simple and clear comparisons of the prices on offer for the product under consideration, all on a single screen with a few mouse clicks. The sites manage to save the prospective shopper a significant amount of effort, time, and money, while also alleviating the headache of gathering information.
